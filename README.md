# 22OpsPrBot Documentation

## Introduction
22OpsPrBot is an automated GitHub bot built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot). It was designed to manage and streamline the pull request (PR) deployment process using Docker. The bot deploys PRs into isolated Docker containers for testing and review purposes, provides real-time deployment status updates, and cleans up resources upon PR closure.

## Features
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploys each PR in an isolated Docker container.
- **Multitasking**: handles pull request on multipe branches at the same time.
- **Real-time Updates**: Comments on PRs with deployment status and links.
- **Real-time Status Check**: Implements status checks for PR deployment and approval review.
- **Resource Management**: Cleans up Docker containers upon PR closure.

## Prerequisites
- A linux/ubuntu server (To avoid any issues, ensure that your user has sudo privileges)
- A GitHub repository with appropriate permissions.

## Setup and Installation

### Setting up Environment
This requires the installation of all dependencies and a setup of all environment variables needed. To simplify the process and ensure compatible versions of dependencies are used, a script _environment_setup.sh_ has been added. 

### Clone the Repository
   - Ensure git is installed. Run:
   ```sh
   git --version
   ```
   If git is not installed, then install git using:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install git -y
   ```
   Then clone the GitHub repository:
   ```sh
   # Clone the Github repository
   git clone https://github.com/rotimiAbiola/22OpsPrBot.git
   # Change directory into the project directory
   cd 22OpsPrBot
   ```

### Run the Setup Script
   ```sh
   # To make the file executable
   sudo chmod +x environment_setup.sh
   # Run the environment_setup.sh
   bash environment_setup.sh
   ```

3. Select _**Use an existing Github App**_
4. Fill the form with the necessary details.
5. Check to confirm the installation of the github app on your repository.
      - Under Repository Settings > GitHub Apps
      - Check to see if the App you installed is on the list.

6. Configure the Repository webhook settings
      - Go to Repository Settings:
      - Pass in the Webhook URL:
      - Pass in the secret (must be the same secret used while installing the App)

```sh
pm2 log npm
```

## Usage

- **Create a Pull Request**: When a new PR is created or reopened, the bot is triggered and the pull request is deployed to a Docker container.
- **Real-time Status Updates**: The bot comments on the PR with the deployment status and a link to the deployed environment.
- **Subsequent Commits**: Any new commits to the open PR branch deploys a Docker container with the latest changes.
- **PR Closure**: Upon PR closure, the bot cleans up the associated Docker containers to free up resources.
