# 22OpsPrBot Documentation

## Introduction
22OpsPrBot is an automated GitHub bot built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot). It was designed to manage and streamline the pull request (PR) deployment process using Docker. The bot deploys PRs into isolated Docker containers for testing and review purposes, provides real-time deployment status updates, and cleans up resources upon PR closure.

## Features
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploys each PR in an isolated Docker container.
- **Multitasking**: handles pull request on multipe branches at the same time.
- **Real-time Updates**: Comments on PRs with deployment status and links.
- **Real-time Status Check**: Implements status checks for PR deployment and approval review.
- **Resource Management**: Cleans up Docker containers upon PR closure.

## Prerequisites
- A linux/ubuntu server
- A GitHub repository with appropriate permissions.

## Setup and Installation

### Setting up Environment
This requires installation of all dependencies and a setup of all environment variables needed. To simplify the process and ensure compatible versions of dependencies are used, a script environment_setup.sh has been added. 

   ```sh
   # To make the file executable
     chmod +x environment_setup.sh
   # Run the environment_setup.sh
     bash environment_setup.sh
   ```

### Clone the Repository
   ```sh
   # Clone the Github repository
     git clone https://github.com/rotimiAbiola/22OpsPrBot.git
   # Change directory into the project directory
     cd 22OpsPrBot
